# SMTP Outgoing Server 

An outgoing SMTP mail server is the machine speaking SMTP protocol that handles all email delivery process (hence the name, outgoing: it takes care of sent emails). Any common email provider – the likes of Gmail, Yahoo, AOL etc. – has an own SMTP server that can be easily configured on a mail client or software (Thunderbird, Outlook…) to send your messages directly from the desktop. The whole setup process is very quick, but you’ll need the right SMTP details.

Below are some of the most popular SMTP names. In case you don’t find yours, the best thing is to ask directly your email provider.

# SMTP Username & Password

SMTP username and password are used to connect with your email providers to fetch/send the emails from the system.

SMTP usernames and passwords are provided by the email service provider.

If you are using Gmail, Yahoo, etc. Your SMTP username is your email account and the SMTP password is the password for your email account.

# SMTP Relay Delay

This means the time (in seconds) you want the program to wait for before sending mail to each recipient.

For example, if the SMTP Relay Delay is set to "2", then the program will wait every 2 seconds before sending another mail to the next recipient.

# SMTP Port

An SMTP port is a communication endpoint that handles the transfer of email data over SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) as it moves through a network, from one server to another.

Ports 25, 465, 587, or 2525 for SMTP have all been considered standard SMTP ports at some point, but only 587 or 2525 really should be considered for modern use.
